NEW PATCHES:
1. Removed Start/Stop Button (Program will not automatically start if you select the area, itemid or magplant, break or place).
2. Fixed not-restarting issue (Program will now stop if there are no selected area, or no mode is chosen(break/place) or no itemid/magplant).
3. Fixed eating too much cpu usage/cpu leak.

How to use:
1. Make sure you are standing in the BFG area.
2. Put an itemid manually or select the magplant to use the remote.
3. Select are which you wanted to place/break the block (Center is where your character is).
4. Choose between break or place, or it can also be both if you're doing a bfg
5. Program should take a second to initialize then it will be running.
